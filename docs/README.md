# BMAD Integration Documentation

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
This documentation serves as the **definitive technical specification** for the BioSpark Health AI integration project. These documents provide comprehensive PRD-level guidance for AI agents implementing the 4-phase BMAD integration strategy.

## ðŸ“š Documentation Structure

### Core Documentation
- **[Integration Strategy](./integration-strategy/README.md)** - 26-week phased approach and strategic framework
- **[Technical Specifications](./technical-specs/README.md)** - Detailed architecture and system requirements
- **[Implementation Roadmap](./implementation/README.md)** - 4-phase execution plan with timelines
- **[Component Mapping](./component-mapping/README.md)** - Exact code integration points and dependencies
- **[Agent Reports](./agent-reports/README.md)** - Specialized agent analysis and recommendations
- **[Executive Summary](./executive-summary.md)** - High-level project overview and key decisions

## ðŸš€ Quick Start for AI Agents

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Weeks 1-6)
1. Review [Technical Specifications](./technical-specs/architecture-analysis.md)
2. Follow [Component Mapping](./component-mapping/integration-points.md)
3. Execute [Implementation Roadmap Phase 1](./implementation/phase-1-foundation.md)

### Phase 2: Core Integration (Weeks 7-14)
1. Implement [Core Systems](./implementation/phase-2-core.md)
2. Follow [Integration Patterns](./technical-specs/integration-patterns.md)
3. Validate against [Quality Gates](./implementation/quality-gates.md)

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 15-22)
1. Deploy [Advanced Components](./implementation/phase-3-advanced.md)
2. Implement [AI Agent Framework](./technical-specs/agent-framework.md)
3. Execute [Testing Strategy](./implementation/testing-strategy.md)

### Phase 4: Production & Optimization (Weeks 23-26)
1. Follow [Production Deployment](./implementation/phase-4-production.md)
2. Implement [Monitoring & Analytics](./technical-specs/monitoring.md)
3. Execute [Performance Optimization](./implementation/optimization.md)
